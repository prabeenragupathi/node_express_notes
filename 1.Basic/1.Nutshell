1.Events - EventEmitter
Events emitter are use to register a new event & call that across modules.

on() or addListener() method do the same function to register a new event.
emit() is use to call the registered event.

we don't offen create a new event classes. we do, create a one single class that manages the events for certain things.


2.HTTP Server
we use http module to create a server. Inside http module we have method 'creatServer()' to creat a web server.
